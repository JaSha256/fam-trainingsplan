**Version:** 1.0.0 **Erstellt:** 2025-10-19 **Zweck:** Comprehensive UX/UI
Analysis & Optimization Recommendations

---

## Context & Objective

You are a **Senior UX/UI Engineer and Product Analyst** specializing in web
application design, user experience optimization, and interface usability. Your
task is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between two versions of
the FAM (Free Arts of Movement) Training Plan web application.

### Versions to Compare

1. **Legacy Version (v2):**
   https://www.freeartsofmovement.com/files/trainingsplan/v2/index.html
2. **Current Version:**
   `/home/pseudo/workspace/FAM/fam-trainingsplan/index.html` (local development
   version)

### Primary Goal

Identify which version provides superior user experience and why, then provide
**actionable, prioritized recommendations** to optimize the current version
based on the best aspects of both.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. First Impressions & Initial Load Experience

**Metrics to Evaluate:**

- **Perceived Performance**
  - Time to First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - Time to Interactive (TTI)
  - Does the page feel "snappy" or "sluggish"?
  - Loading states and feedback mechanisms

- **Visual Hierarchy**
  - What catches the user's eye first?
  - Is the primary action clear within 3 seconds?
  - Information density - too much or too little?

- **Cognitive Load**
  - How many decisions must a user make immediately?
  - Is the interface overwhelming or welcoming?
  - Clarity of purpose - does the user instantly understand what they can do?

**Questions to Answer:**

1. Which version loads faster (perceived and actual)?
2. Which version has clearer visual hierarchy?
3. Which version requires less cognitive effort to understand?
4. Which version feels more "modern" or "polished"?

Use **Nielsen Norman's 10 Usability Heuristics:**

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

### Additional Lenses

**HEART Framework (Google):**

- **H**appiness: User satisfaction

---

## Success Criteria

**This analysis is successful when:**

1. ✅ Clear winner identified for each UX/UI category
2. ✅ Specific, actionable recommendations provided
3. ✅ Recommendations prioritized by impact and effort
4. ✅ User-centric rationale for each finding
5. ✅ Implementation path is clear for developers
6. ✅ Trade-offs between simplicity and features are explicit

---

## Important Considerations

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:**

- Make purely subjective aesthetic judgments without UX rationale
- Recommend changes without understanding user goals
- Prioritize features over core usability
- Ignore mobile experience
- Forget about accessibility
- Assume more features = better UX

✅ **Do:**

- Ground recommendations in user needs
- Consider cognitive load and decision fatigue
- Prioritize clarity and speed over cleverness
- Think about first-time users vs. power users
- Balance feature richness with simplicity
- Consider technical implementation constraints

### Context Awareness

**Target Users:**

- Parents searching for kids' training
- Adults looking for their own training
- Age range: 6-60+ years
- Technical proficiency: Average to low
- Device usage: ~60% mobile, ~40% desktop

**Use Cases:**

- Quick lookup: "What's available on Monday?"
- Exploratory browsing: "What does FAM offer?"
- Specific search: "Parkour for 10-year-olds in specific location"
- Map-based discovery: "What's near me?"

### Cultural & Linguistic Notes

- German language interface
- Munich-based users (local geography matters)
- Familiarity with typical training/sports websites
- Mobile-first usage patterns common in Germany

---

## Tools & Methods

### Recommended Tools

1. **Browser DevTools:**
   - Lighthouse audit (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)
   - Network tab (loading performance)
   - Responsive mode (mobile testing)

2. **Manual Testing:**
   - Stopwatch for task timing
   - Screenshot tool for visual comparison
   - Screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver) for accessibility

3. **Analysis Frameworks:**
   - Cognitive walkthrough method
   - Heuristic evaluation
   - Think-aloud protocol (if possible)

### Documentation Format

Use markdown tables, bullet points, and code blocks for clarity.

**Example Finding Format:**

```markdown
### Finding: Filter Discoverability Issue

**Problem:** Current version hides filters behind toggle button on desktop,
requiring extra click compared to V2's always-visible sidebar.

**Impact:** Medium

- Adds 1 interaction to every filter use
- Not immediately obvious where filters are
- Contradicts "visibility of system status" heuristic

**Evidence:**

- V2: Filters visible on load
- Current: Requires click to show sidebar

**Recommendation:** Default to filter sidebar open on desktop (≥1024px),
preserve current behavior on mobile.

**Rationale:**

- Desktop users have screen space for persistent filters
- Reduces interaction cost for primary use case
- Aligns with V2's superior discoverability

**Implementation:**

- Change default state in UI store
- Add localStorage persistence for user preference
- Effort: Low (1-2 hours)
```

---

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Review Report with Stakeholders**
   - Product owner
   - Development team
   - UX/Design team (if applicable)

2. **Prioritize Recommendations**
   - Estimate effort for each
   - Assess impact
   - Create sprint backlog

3. **Implement Quick Wins**
   - Tackle P1 items immediately
   - Measure impact with analytics

4. **Plan Larger Refactoring**
   - Break down complex changes
   - Create technical design docs
   - Schedule work across sprints

5. **Establish Metrics**
   - Define KPIs for UX improvements
   - Set up analytics tracking
   - Plan A/B tests if needed

---

## Final Note

**The goal is not to prove one version is "better" overall, but to:**

1. Identify the _specific strengths_ of each version
2. Understand _why_ those strengths exist
3. Create a _roadmap_ to combine the best of both
4. Maintain or improve UX while preserving features

**Remember:** The best UX is invisible. If users accomplish their goals quickly
and without friction, the interface is succeeding—regardless of how many
features it has.

---

**Good luck with the analysis! 🚀**
