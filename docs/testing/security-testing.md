# Security Testing Documentation

## Overview

Comprehensive security test suite covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for the FAM Trainingsplan application.

**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Test Framework:** Playwright E2E
**Coverage Focus:** Client-side security, XSS prevention, secure storage, security headers

---

## Test Categories

### 1. XSS Protection Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/security/xss-protection.spec.js`
**Tests:** 10 tests
**Coverage:**

- Search input XSS protection (5 payload tests)
- Filter input XSS protection
- URL parameter XSS protection
- LocalStorage XSS protection
- Alpine.js template XSS protection

**Key Payloads Tested:**
- Script tags: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
- Event handlers: `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>`
- JavaScript protocol: `javascript:alert("XSS")`
- SVG onload: `<svg/onload=alert("XSS")>`
- Iframe injection: `<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')">`

**OWASP Mapping:** A03:2021 - Injection

---

### 2. CSP Validation Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/security/csp-validation.spec.js`
**Tests:** 5 tests
**Coverage:**

- CSP header/meta tag presence check
- CSP directive validation (default-src, script-src)
- Inline script blocking verification
- Frame-ancestors (clickjacking protection)
- CSP violation reporting configuration

**Current State:**
- No CSP headers present (GitHub Pages limitation)
- Recommendations provided for meta tag implementation

**OWASP Mapping:** A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

---

### 3. Security Headers Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/security/security-headers.spec.js`
**Tests:** 6 tests
**Coverage:**

- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)
- X-Powered-By (should NOT be present)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS for HTTPS)
- Complete security headers audit

**Current State:**
- 0/8 security headers present
- GitHub Pages has limited header support
- Recommendations: Use meta tags or migrate to Cloudflare Pages

**OWASP Mapping:** A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

---

### 4. Input Validation Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/security/input-validation.spec.js`
**Tests:** 6 tests
**Coverage:**

- Search input max length enforcement
- Special character handling (`<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`, `/`, `\`)
- Filter value validation
- JSON injection prevention (prototype pollution)
- Malformed URL parameter handling
- Filter array size limits

**Findings:**
- Search input has no max length (recommendation: add maxLength attribute)
- Filter arrays have no size limit (recommendation: add validation)
- App gracefully handles all tested edge cases

**OWASP Mapping:** A03:2021 - Injection

---

### 5. LocalStorage Security Tests
**File:** `tests/e2e/security/localstorage-security.spec.js`
**Tests:** 7 tests
**Coverage:**

- Sensitive data detection in localStorage
- Favorites data structure validation
- Filter state validation
- Corrupted localStorage handling
- LocalStorage quota limits
- Cache data structure validation
- LocalStorage usage documentation

**Findings:**
- No sensitive data patterns detected (passwords, tokens, secrets)
- Total localStorage usage: ~0.60 KB (well within limits)
- App gracefully handles corrupted data with fallbacks

**OWASP Mapping:** A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures

## Running Security Tests

### Run All Security Tests
```bash
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/
```

### Run Specific Category
```bash
# XSS Protection
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/xss-protection.spec.js

# CSP Validation
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/csp-validation.spec.js

# Security Headers
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/security-headers.spec.js

# Input Validation
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/input-validation.spec.js

# LocalStorage Security
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/localstorage-security.spec.js
```

### Run with Specific Browser
```bash
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/ --project=chromium
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/ --project=firefox
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/ --project=webkit
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/ --debug
pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/ --headed
```

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 33+ security tests
**Current Pass Rate:** ~76% (25/33 passing)
**Timeout Issues:** 8 tests (CSP validation, XSS checks with data load requirements)

### Passing Tests (25)
- All LocalStorage security tests (7/7)
- All Security Headers tests (6/6)
- Input Validation tests (5/6)
- CSP basic tests (2/5)
- XSS basic tests (5/10)

### Known Issues
**Timeout Issues:** Some tests timeout waiting for full data load
- **Solution:** Tests now wait only for Alpine.js framework, not full data load
- **Status:** Improved but some edge cases still timeout in CI

## Security Findings

### High Priority
**None identified** - No critical security vulnerabilities found

### Medium Priority

#### 1. Missing Security Headers
**Issue:** No HTTP security headers configured
**Impact:** Increased XSS/Clickjacking risk
**Recommendation:** Add CSP meta tags to `index.html`

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self';
           script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com;
           style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com;
           img-src 'self' data: https:;
           connect-src 'self' https://jasha256.github.io https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org">
<meta http-equiv="X-Content-Type-Options" content="nosniff">
<meta name="referrer" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">
```

### Low Priority

#### 1. Input Length Limits
**Issue:** Search input and filter arrays have no max length
**Impact:** Potential DoS via extremely long inputs
**Recommendation:** Add maxLength attribute and array size validation

#### 2. Filter Array Size
**Issue:** Filters can accept unlimited array items
**Impact:** Performance degradation with huge selections
**Recommendation:** Limit filter selections to reasonable max (e.g., 50)

## Continuous Security Testing

### CI/CD Integration
Security tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Security Tests
  run: pnpm playwright test tests/e2e/security/
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before each release:
- [ ] Run full security test suite
- [ ] Review security headers configuration
- [ ] Check for new npm vulnerabilities (`pnpm audit`)
- [ ] Verify CSP meta tags are present
- [ ] Test with production build

---

## Maintenance

### Updating XSS Payloads
Add new payloads to `xss-protection.spec.js`:
```javascript
const xssPayloads = [
  // Add new OWASP-recommended payloads here
  '<script>alert("XSS")</script>',
  // ...
]
```

### Adding New Security Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/e2e/security/`
2. Follow naming convention: `[category]-security.spec.js`
3. Document in this file
4. Add to CI/CD pipeline
