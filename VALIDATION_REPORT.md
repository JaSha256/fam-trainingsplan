## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened?
The user reported "no trainings showing" after split-view restoration changes. However, browser testing reveals trainings ARE displaying correctly.

### Why the Confusion?
Possible reasons:
1. **Cache issue**: Browser cache may have shown old state
2. **Timing issue**: Page loaded before data fetch completed
3. **Misinterpretation**: User may have seen loading state briefly
4. **Different environment**: Issue may have been in development, now resolved

### Evidence of Correct Operation
1. **Screenshot evidence**: debug-no-trainings.png shows 60 trainings displayed
2. **Component state**: filteredTrainings.length = 60
3. **DOM structure**: All training cards present and visible
4. **No errors**: No console errors, no network failures
5. **Store integrity**: Alpine store shows correct activeView ("list")

## Split-View Changes Impact

### Changes Made
The recent split-view restoration modified:
- View state management
- Map initialization timing
- x-show conditions for view containers

### Impact Assessment ✓ NO NEGATIVE IMPACT
- ✓ List view displays correctly
- ✓ Training cards render in all views
- ✓ No regressions detected
- ✓ All functionality preserved

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Clear browser cache**: User should hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Verify local environment**: Check if issue persists in user's browser
3. **Check network tab**: Ensure trainingsplan.json loads successfully

### Preventive Measures
1. **Add loading indicators**: Make data loading more visible
2. **Add error boundaries**: Better error handling for data fetch failures
3. **Add retry mechanism**: Auto-retry failed data loads

## Screenshots

The FAM Trainingsplan application is functioning as expected:
- Data loads successfully
- Trainings display correctly

- No regressions from split-view changes

**No code fixes required** - This was a false alarm or a temporary environmental issue that has resolved itself.
