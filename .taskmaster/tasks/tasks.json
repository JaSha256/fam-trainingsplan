Component uses segmented button pattern with `bg-slate-100 rounded-lg` container and `flex-1` tabs for equal distribution.

All methods include proper JSDoc TypeScript definitions.\n\nâœ… **Code refactored for quality (REFACTOR phase)**: Implementation includes input validation (only accepts 'list', 'map', 'favorites'), maintains backward compatibility by syncing mapModalOpen state, uses proper TypeScript annotations, and follows project coding standards.\n\nðŸ“Š **Test Results**: 21/21 passing - Full coverage of view switching logic, validation rules, state synchronization, and edge cases.

        "details": "Create a desktop view switcher component using the existing M3 segmented button design system from src/styles/m3-components.css (.md-segmented-button-container and .md-segmented-button classes). Position the component in the desktop sidebar header area (around line 314-331 in index.html) as a prominent navigation element. The switcher should: 1) Use Alpine.js $store.ui.activeView state (defined in src/main.js) with three options: 'list', 'map', 'favorites' 2) Apply 'lg:block hidden' classes for desktop-only visibility 3) Include proper ARIA attributes (role='tablist', aria-label, aria-selected) for accessibility 4) Implement M3 hover states using existing CSS (.md-segmented-button[aria-selected='false']:hover and .md-segmented-button[aria-selected='true']:hover) 5) Use Heroicons for consistent iconography (list-bullet, map, heart) 6) Integrate with existing setActiveView() method from Alpine store 7) Follow the established pattern from mobile view switcher (lines 123-162) but adapt for desktop layout 8) Ensure smooth transitions using M3 motion tokens (--md-sys-motion-duration-short4, --md-sys-motion-easing-emphasized) 9) Position prominently in sidebar expanded state, possibly replacing or augmenting the current header section 10) Test with existing activeView state persistence system (Alpine.$persist)",
        "testStrategy": "Create comprehensive test suite covering: 1) Responsive visibility testing (desktop-only lg:block behavior) 2) Alpine store integration tests for activeView state synchronization 3) M3 design compliance validation (segmented button styling, hover states, transitions) 4) Keyboard navigation and ARIA accessibility testing 5) Visual regression tests comparing to mobile view switcher design 6) Integration tests with existing view switching functionality 7) Mouse hover state behavior verification 8) State persistence testing across browser sessions 9) Cross-browser compatibility testing for desktop layouts 10) Performance testing for smooth M3 transitions and animations",
