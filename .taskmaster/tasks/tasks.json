Implementation features: (1) Three tabs with Material Design icons and responsive labels (Liste/List, Karte/Map, Favoriten/Favorites), (2) Alpine.js click handlers setting `$store.ui.activeView` state to 'list', 'map', or 'favorites', (3) Dynamic conditional styling using `:class` bindings applying `bg-white shadow-sm` for active state, (4) Material Design 3 compliance with `md-state-layer` class for proper interaction states, (5) Accessibility-compliant touch targets with `py-2.5` ensuring 44px+ minimum height, (6) Full keyboard navigation with semantic button elements, type=\"button\", and descriptive aria-labels, (7) Responsive design with `hidden sm:inline` labels showing text on larger screens. Component uses segmented button pattern with `bg-slate-100 rounded-lg` container and `flex-1` tabs for equal distribution. All 5 TDD unit tests passing (tests/unit/view-switcher.test.js): component rendering, state management, active styling, touch targets, and keyboard accessibility.

The key information I can extract from the test output shows that the activeView store tests are all passing: \"✓ |unit| tests/unit/activeView-store.test.js (21 tests) 6ms\".

The three helper methods have been implemented in src/main.js:155-188 with proper TypeScript JSDoc definitions in the store interface (lines 91-93), input validation, backward compatibility, and all 21 unit tests are passing.\n\n## 🚀 DELIVERY COMPLETE - TDD APPROACH\n\n✅ **Tests written first (RED phase)**: Comprehensive test suite created in tests/unit/activeView-store.test.js with 21 test cases covering all functionality including edge cases, validation, and backward compatibility scenarios.\n\n✅ **Implementation passes all tests (GREEN phase)**: Three helper methods successfully implemented in src/main.js Alpine store (lines 155-188): setActiveView() with validation, isActiveView() checker, and enhanced toggleMapView() with backward compatibility. All methods include proper JSDoc TypeScript definitions.\n\n✅ **Code refactored for quality (REFACTOR phase)**: Implementation includes input validation (only accepts 'list', 'map', 'favorites'), maintains backward compatibility by syncing mapModalOpen state, uses proper TypeScript annotations, and follows project coding standards.\n\n📊 **Test Results**: 21/21 passing - Full coverage of view switching logic, validation rules, state synchronization, and edge cases. Test file: tests/unit/activeView-store.test.js validates setActiveView(), isActiveView(), and toggleMapView() methods with comprehensive scenarios including invalid input handling and state persistence.\n\n**Key Implementation Features**: State persistence via Alpine.$persist, input validation with silent rejection of invalid values, seamless mapModalOpen synchronization for backward compatibility, comprehensive JSDoc TypeScript definitions, and robust error handling.\n</info added on 2025-10-21T21:35:29.299Z>",

Position the component in the desktop sidebar header area (around line 314-331 in index.html) as a prominent navigation element. The switcher should: 1) Use Alpine.js $store.ui.activeView state (defined in src/main.js) with three options: 'list', 'map', 'favorites' 2) Apply 'lg:block hidden' classes for desktop-only visibility 3) Include proper ARIA attributes (role='tablist', aria-label, aria-selected) for accessibility 4) Implement M3 hover states using existing CSS (.md-segmented-button[aria-selected='false']:hover and .md-segmented-button[aria-selected='true']:hover) 5) Use Heroicons for consistent iconography (list-bullet, map, heart) 6) Integrate with existing setActiveView() method from Alpine store 7) Follow the established pattern from mobile view switcher (lines 123-162) but adapt for desktop layout 8) Ensure smooth transitions using M3 motion tokens (--md-sys-motion-duration-short4, --md-sys-motion-easing-emphasized) 9) Position prominently in sidebar expanded state, possibly replacing or augmenting the current header section 10) Test with existing activeView state persistence system (Alpine.$persist)",

        "details": "**Scope:** Redesign mobile header (lines 189-487 in index.html) to address visual clutter and improve user experience while maintaining ALL existing functionality.\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n1. **Visual Clutter:** Mobile header contains too many competing elements (logo, filter button, view switcher, overflow menu)\n2. **Poor Hierarchy:** Unclear distinction between primary (filter, view switch) and secondary actions (export, share, settings)\n3. **Filter Experience:** Filter button, quick filters, and active filter chips create chaotic visual flow\n4. **Hidden Discoverability:** Important actions buried in overflow menu\n\n**Solution Architecture:**\n1. **Primary Action Bar:** Keep essential actions (Filter, View Switcher) in compact header\n2. **Bottom Navigation:** Move view switching to bottom nav (Tasks 19/21 completed) - integrate better\n3. **Collapsible Sections:** Implement progressive disclosure for quick filters using Alpine.js collapse\n4. **Action Sheet Pattern:** Replace overflow menu with Material Design action sheet for bulk actions\n5. **Visual Separation:** Use M3 elevation tokens and surface containers for clear hierarchy\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- **Header Redesign:** Reduce header height to 48px (Task 16 done), consolidate logo+title, single primary filter button with badge\n- **Progressive Disclosure:** Implement collapsible quick filters section with slide-down animation using @alpinejs/collapse\n- **Action Grouping:** Group related actions (Export: ICS/Print, Share: Link/Favorites, Settings: Dark Mode/Location) with clear visual separation\n- **M3 Components:** Use existing .md-state-layer, .md-surface-container-high classes from src/styles/m3-components.css\n- **Touch Targets:** Maintain ≥44px touch targets per WCAG guidelines\n- **Accessibility:** Preserve all ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- **Alpine.js Store:** Add new state for collapsible sections (quickFiltersExpanded, actionSheetOpen)\n- **CSS Classes:** Use M3 surface containers (.md-surface-container, .md-surface-container-high) for elevation hierarchy\n- **Animation:** Implement smooth transitions using Alpine collapse plugin and M3 motion tokens\n- **Responsive:** Ensure design works across mobile breakpoints (375px, 390px, 428px)\n- **Integration:** Coordinate with existing filter chips bar (Task 15) and bottom navigation (Task 19)\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- index.html (lines 189-487): Mobile header restructure\n- src/styles/m3-components.css: Add action sheet and collapsible components if needed\n- src/main.js: Add new Alpine store state for UI controls",
        "testStrategy": "**Testing Strategy:**\n1. **Responsive Testing:** Validate across mobile viewports (375px iPhone SE, 390px iPhone 12, 428px iPhone 14 Pro Max)\n2. **Touch Target Validation:** Verify all interactive elements meet 44px minimum requirement\n3. **Accessibility Testing:** Run axe-core accessibility audit, test keyboard navigation, verify ARIA attributes\n4. **Visual Regression:** Compare before/after screenshots to ensure visual improvements\n5. **Integration Testing:** Verify interaction with existing filter chips (Task 15) and bottom navigation (Task 19)\n6. **User Flow Testing:** Test complete filter → view → action flows on mobile devices\n7. **Animation Performance:** Verify smooth transitions and no janky animations\n8. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test on Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+, Safari 16.4+ (per package.json browserslist)\n9. **Screen Reader Testing:** Validate with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)\n10. **Progressive Enhancement:** Ensure functionality degrades gracefully without JavaScript\n\n**Test Files:**\n- tests/e2e/mobile-menu-redesign.spec.js: Mobile-specific header interactions\n- tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.js: Update for new structure\n- tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.js: Screenshot comparisons\n- tests/integration/mobile-navigation.test.js: Integration with filter system",
